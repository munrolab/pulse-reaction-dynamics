# pulse-reaction-dynamics

pulseon_simple.m contains all the code for generating the figures.  The model differential equation is housed in pulseon_simple_fun.m, 
but keep in mind that there is a non-dimensionalization between the fitting parameters and the input to the differential equation.

More documentation will be forthcoming as we find out how much is going to be used.
